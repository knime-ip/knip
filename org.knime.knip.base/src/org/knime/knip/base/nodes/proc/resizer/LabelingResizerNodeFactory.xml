	<shortDescription>
		Resizes a labeling.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>Resizes the labeling in each dimension. The resulting values at
			each position in the labeling are set according to the resizing
			strategy. Please note, that the input values for each dimension can
			be interpreted in several ways.
		</intro>
		<tab name="Options">
			<option name="Resizing Strategy">
				Determines the strategy, how to fill the resized
				labeling.
				<ol>
					<li>
						Nearest Neighbor Interpolation:

						Pixel values are interpolated
						according to their neighbors.
					</li>
					<li>
						Periodical Extension:

						Pixel values are repeated periodically.
					</li>
					<li>
						Border Extension:

						Pixel values on the border of the labeling are
						repeated.
					</li>
					<li>
						Fill with Zero Value:

						Fill pixel values with zero value of the
						input labeling.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Remark:
					Extensions and Filling Strategies are only useful in the
					case that
					the output labeling is larger than the input labeling.
				</p>
			</option>

			<option name="New Dimension Sizes">
				<p>
					Specify here the size of the resulting labeling for each
					dimension.
					If a dimension doesn't exist in the labeling at hand the
					according
					dimension will be ignored.
					There are three different ways
					of how the
					dimensions of the result labelings will be calculated
					with respected
					to the specified values for each dimension:
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						Absolute Labeling Size:

						Size of the resulting labeling for each
						dimension. Output dimension =
						specified value.
					</li>
					<li>
						Scaling Factor:

						Factor to scale dimensions of input labeling for
						each dimension.
						Output
						dimensions = input dimension * specified
						value.
					</li>
					<li>
						Calibration:

						Input values are interpreted as the new calibration
						values. For
						example, this is useful for arbitrarily calibrated
						labelings, to
						enforce, that the calibration in each dimension is
						one.
						Due to
						rounding
						errors, the resulting
						calibration will only
						approach
						this
						definition (depending on the
						labeling size).
						Output
						dimensions =
						((calibration of input labeling) / (specified value))
						* (input
						dimension).
