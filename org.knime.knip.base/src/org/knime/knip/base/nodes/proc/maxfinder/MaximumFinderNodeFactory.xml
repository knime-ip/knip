	<name>Maximum Finder</name>
	<shortDescription> Find local maxima on an n-dimensional image. </shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>
				MaximumFinder runs over an image, finds points which are larger than all of
				it's neighbors and finally iterates over these points to find the real local
				maxima.
			</p>
			<p>
				To find minima instead, you might want to invert the input.
			</p>
		</intro>
		
		<tab name="Options">
			<option name="Noise Tolerance">
				Sets the tolerance for comparison of two pixels. This is useful when an image
				is affected by unwanted noise.
			</option>
			<option name="Suppression">
				Suppression in MaximumFinder removes maxima which are closer than the suppression value.
				This comes at the cost of a little more computation time.
			</option>	
			<option name="Output with Tolerance Areas"> Will mark tolerance areas instead of single points only. </option>
