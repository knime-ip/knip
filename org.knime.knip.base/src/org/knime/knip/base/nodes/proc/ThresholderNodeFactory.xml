	<name>Global Thresholder (deprecated)</name>
	<shortDescription>
		A threshold is determined manually or calculated
		automatically to
		threshold the image.
    </shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			A thresholder thresholds the intensity values of an image according
			to a given threshold. The result is a binary segmentation.
			Please note
			that you have to use the Connected Component Analysis Node
			after the
			thresholding analysis to extract a segmentation with
			seperated
			segments.
			For details see:
			<i>"Survey over image thresholding techniques and quantitative
				performance evaluation"</i>
			Sezgin04.
