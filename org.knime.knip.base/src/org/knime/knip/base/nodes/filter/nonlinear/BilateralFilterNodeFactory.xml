		<intro>
			Filter the input image using a bilateral filter. Wikipedia: The
			intensity value at each pixel in an image is replaced by a weighted
			average of intensity values from nearby pixels. This weight can be
			based on a Gaussian distribution. Crucially, the weights depend not
			only on Euclidean distance of pixels, but also on the radiometric
			differences. For example, the range difference such as color
			intensity, depth distance, etc. This preserves sharp edges by
			systematically looping through each pixel and adjusting weights to
			the adjacent pixels accordingly.
