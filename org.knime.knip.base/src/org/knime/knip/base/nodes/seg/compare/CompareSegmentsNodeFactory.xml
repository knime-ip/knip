	<name>Compare Segments</name>

	<shortDescription>
		Compares two tables of segments (binary image masks)
		according to how many relativ pixels they have in common. Hence the
		actual segment shape AND the offset (minimum) of the bitmasks are
		considered. NOTE that the sources of the bitmasks have to be the same!
		A column with the maximum relative pixel aggreement with
		respect
		to the
		reference segments is appended to the target column.
