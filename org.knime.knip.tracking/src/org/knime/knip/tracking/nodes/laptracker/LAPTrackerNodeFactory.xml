	<shortDescription>
		Tracking based on the TrackMate (see
		http://fiji.sc/TrackMate).
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>The Linear Assignment Problem (LAP) trackers implemented here
			follow a stripped down version of the renowned method contributed by
			Jaqaman and colleagues[1]. We repeat here the ideas found in the
			reference paper, then stresses the differences with the nominal
			implementation. Particle-linking happens in two step: track segments
			creation from frame-to-frame particle linking, then track segments
			linking to achieve gap closing. The mathematical formulation used for
			both steps is linear assignment problem (LAP): a cost matrix is
			assembled contained all possible assignment costs. Actual assignments
			are retrieved by solving this matrix for minimal total cost. We
			describe first how cost matrices are arranged, then how individual
			costs are calculated (from http://fiji.sc/TrackMate).

		<tab name="Options">
			<option name="Algorithm">Choose the implementation. Munkres-Kuhn is faster
				than Hungarian, but sometimes performs worse. Another alternative is
				Jonker Volgenant Algorithm, which
				is very fast and accurate.
			</option>
			<option name="Maximum Object Distance">Maximum distance between to objects</option>
			<option name="Tracking Dimension">Select the dimension which will be used for
				tracking (in most cases its Time).
			</option>
			<option name="Allow Splitting">If checked, the algorithm tries to detect
				splitting objects.
			</option>
			<option name="Max Distance (Splitting)">Maximum distance two splitting objects may have.
			</option>
			<option name="Allow Merging">If checked, the algorithm tries to detect
				merging
				objects
			</option>
			<option name="Max Distance (Merging)">Maximum distance two merging objects may have.
			</option>
			<option name="Allow Gap Closing">If checked, a missing object at a certain
				frame
				can be recovered using the following tracking frames.
			</option>
			<option name="Max Distance (Gap Distance)">Maximum distance two objects may have, such that
				their track can be recovered using gap closing.
			</option>
			<option name="Max Gap Size (Frames)">Number of frames which can be skipped for
				gap-closing.

			<option name="Cutoff Percentile">Cut-Off Percentile (see http://fiji.sc/TrackMate
				for details).
			</option>
			<option name="Attach Original Labelings"> Attaches the original labelings
				to the tracks, so that each labeled pixel keeps his original labels.

			<option name="Use a Custom Track Prefix"> If a custom prefix for the tracknames is used
				instead of the default one "Track: ".
			</option>
			<option name="Custom Track Prefix">The prefix for the name of the tracks. If used
				together with <b>Attach Original Labelings</b>, make sure to enter a name
				that is not part of the name of any labeling.
