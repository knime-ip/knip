		<intro>
			The Linear Assignment Problem (LAP) trackers implemented here follow a stripped down
			version of the renowned method contributed by Jaqaman and colleagues[1]. We repeat
			here the ideas found in the reference paper, then stresses the differences with
			the nominal implementation. Particle-linking happens in two step: track segments
			creation from frame-to-frame particle linking, then track segments linking to achieve
			gap closing. The mathematical formulation used for both steps is linear assignment
			problem (LAP): a cost matrix is assembled contained all possible assignment costs.
			Actual assignments are retrieved by solving this matrix for minimal total cost.
			We describe first how cost matrices are arranged, then how individual costs are
			calculated (from http://fiji.sc/TrackMate).

			<option name="Calculate Track features">
				Calculates various features for each track and makes them avaiable at the second output
				port.
				<br />
				<br />
				Notable Features:
				<ul>
					<li>
						The Longest Gap describes the lenght (in time units) of the longest gap int the track.
					</li>
					<li>
						The Complex points counted in the "Number of Complex Points" features are defined
						as follows. A Complex Point has several imidiate predecessors (like a merge)
						as well as several successors (like a split) regarding the surrounding time
						slices.
					</li>
					<li>
						The Track Duration describes the total ammount of time the Track is visible.
					</li>
					<li>
						The Track Start describes the first timepoint a track appears at.
					</li>
					<li>The Track End describes the last timepoint a track appears at.</li>
					<li>
						The Track Displacement describes the total distance traveled by the tracked object.
					</li>
				</ul>
				Calibration of the Features: (Customizable calibration will be avaiable in a future
				version).
				<ul>
					<li>Location based features: 1 = 1 mm</li>
					<li>Time based features 1 = 1 sec</li>
				</ul>
			</option>
			<option name="Attach Original Labelings">
				Attaches the original labelings to the tracks, so that each labeled pixel keeps his
				original labels.
			</option>
			<option name="Use a Custom Track Prefix">
				If a custom prefix for the tracknames is used instead of the default one "Track: ".
			</option>
			<option name="Custom Track Prefix">
				The prefix for the name of the tracks. If used
                together with
				<b>Attach Original Labelings</b>
				, make sure to enter a name that is not part of the name of any labeling.
