    <fullDescription>
        <intro>The Linear Assignment Problem (LAP) trackers implemented here
            follow a stripped down version of the renowned method contributed by
            Jaqaman and colleagues[1]. We repeat here the ideas found in the
            reference paper, then stresses the differences with the nominal
            implementation. Particle-linking happens in two step: track segments
            creation from frame-to-frame particle linking, then track segments
            linking to achieve gap closing. The mathematical formulation used for
            both steps is linear assignment problem (LAP): a cost matrix is
            assembled contained all possible assignment costs. Actual assignments
            are retrieved by solving this matrix for minimal total cost. We
            describe first how cost matrices are arranged, then how individual
            costs are calculated (from http://fiji.sc/TrackMate).

                Calculates various features for each track and makes them avaiable
                at the second output port.
                <br />
                <br />
                Notable Features:
                <ul>
                    <li> The Longest Gap describes the lenght (in time units) of the
                        longest gap int the track.</li>
                    <li> The Complex points counted in the "Number of Complex Points"
                        features are defined as follows.
                        A Complex Point has several imidiate predecessors (like a merge) as
                        well as several successors     (like a split) regarding the surrounding time slices.</li>
                    <li> The Track Duration describes the total ammount of time the
                        Track is visible.</li>
                    <li> The Track Start describes the first timepoint a track appears
                        at.</li>
                    <li> The Track End describes the last timepoint a track appears at.</li>
                    <li> The Track Displacement describes the total distance traveled
                        by the tracked object.</li>
                </ul>

                Calibration of the Features: (Customizable calibration will be
                avaiable in a future version).
                <ul>
                    <li>Location based features: 1 = 1 mm  </li>
                    <li>Time based features 1 = 1 sec </li>
                </ul>
            </option>
            <option name="Attach Original Labelings"> Attaches the original labelings
                to the tracks, so
                that each labeled pixel keeps his original labels.
            </option>
            <option name="Use a Custom Track Prefix"> If a custom prefix for the tracknames is used
                instead of the default one "Track: ".
            </option>
            <option name="Custom Track Prefix">
                The prefix for the name of the tracks. If used
                together with <b>Attach Original Labelings</b>,
                make sure to enter a name that is not part of the name of any labeling.
