/**
 * Class to represent a pixel as a node in a graph.
 *
 * This implementation was <b>heavily</b> inspired by the implementation provided by Kolmogorov and Boykov: MAXFLOW
 * version 3.01.
 *
 * From the README of the library:
 *
 * This software library implements the maxflow algorithm described in
 *
 * "An Experimental Comparison of Min-Cut/Max-Flow Algorithms for Energy Minimization in Vision." Yuri Boykov and
 * Vladimir Kolmogorov. In IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI), September 2004
 *
 * This algorithm was developed by Yuri Boykov and Vladimir Kolmogorov at Siemens Corporate Research. To make it
 * available for public use, it was later reimplemented by Vladimir Kolmogorov based on open publications.
 *
 * If you use this software for research purposes, you should cite the aforementioned paper in any resulting
 * publication.
