	<shortDescription>
		Tracking based on the TrackMate (see http://fiji.sc/TrackMate).
		Hier: http://fiji.sc/TrackMate_algorithms#cite_note-1 rein basteln.

		<intro>The Linear Assignment Problem (LAP) trackers implemented here
			follow a stripped down version of the renowned method contributed by
			Jaqaman and colleagues[1]. We repeat here the ideas found in the
			reference paper, then stresses the differences with the nominal
			implementation. Particle-linking happens in two step: track segments
			creation from frame-to-frame particle linking, then track segments
			linking to achieve gap closing. The mathematical formulation used for
			both steps is linear assignment problem (LAP): a cost matrix is
			assembled contained all possible assignment costs. Actual assignments
			are retrieved by solving this matrix for minimal total cost. We
			describe first how cost matrices are arranged, then how individual
			costs are calculated (from http://fiji.sc/TrackMate).
