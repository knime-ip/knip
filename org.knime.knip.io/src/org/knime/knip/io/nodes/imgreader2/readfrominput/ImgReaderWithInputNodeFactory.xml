	<name>Image Reader With Input</name>
	<shortDescription>
		Reads images from possibly different directories and
		imports them to the
		KNIME-internal image format. The images will be
		read an as PlanarImages, which means that they are optimized for the
		access of the first two dimensions. To convert them to another image
		format (ArrayImg if you want to process the whole image at once)
		please make use of
		the converter node.

		Image can also be downloaded and read from URLs (e.g. http://...). The URLs have to be provided via the input table (as strings).
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Reads images from various file formats supported by the Bio-Formats
			library and imports them to the KNIME-internal image format.
			A list of
			the supported formats can be found here:
			<a href="http://loci.wisc.edu/bio-formats/formats">http://loci.wisc.edu/bio-formats/formats</a>.

			Image can also be downloaded and read from URLs (e.g. http://...). The URLs have to be provided via the input table (as strings).
		</intro>
		<tab name="Options">
			<option name="File browser">
				Choose your image files here and add them to the
				list of selected files.
				An image preview is available which will also
				help you to determine,
				whether an image format is supported or not.
				The list of the core meta data gives you some more information about
				the
				image object.
			</option>
		</tab>
		<tab name="Additional Options">
			<option name="OME-XML-metadata">
				You can either add a column containing the metadata formated as
				an OML-XML-String, read only the metadata from the images files, or just read the
				images (default).
				(for more details see:
				<a href="http://www.ome-xml.org/">http://www.ome-xml.org/</a>
				).
			</option>
			<option name="Read non OME-XML Metadata">
				Read metadata that is not part of the ome-xml specification.
				It will be appended as XML annotation to the ome-xml metadata. </option>
			<option name="Image Factory">Defines the way how the images are created and
				therewith kept in memory: Array Image Factory (stored as ONE array;
				pros: fast pixel access; cons: limited number of pixels per image),
				Planar Image Factory (each plane is stored in an array; pros: images
				are read faster; cons: limited number of pixels in an XY-plane,
				slower pixel access), and Cell Image Factory (multiple arrays of
				fixed sizes are used, pros: unlimited number of pixels per images;
				cons: very slow pixel reading and pixel access))</option>
			<option name="Use complete file path as row key">
				If checked, the complete file path will be used
				as
				row key, else only
				the file name. Has no effect, if images are read from URLs.</option>
			<option name="Check file format for each file">Checks for each file individually the
				file-format, if checked. Else, the file format as assumed to be the
				same for all files and only if the reading fails, the new file
				format will be determined.</option>
			<option name="File name column in optional table">If another node with a string column is plugged
				to the optional in-port, the column, which contains the potential
				file paths, can be selected.</option>
			<option name="Read all series">Some image file formats might contain multiple
				images (called series). One can either read all available series
				(each appended as own table row) or just one series with the specified
				index ("Series index").
			</option>
			<option name="Load group files">If selected, related group files will be read as
				well.</option>

		</tab>
		<tab name="Subset Selection">
			<option name="Image Subset Selection">
				Select the image planes here you actually want to
				open. Use shift or
				ctrl-keys to mark more than one plane or the
				"all"-checkbox to select
				all available planes. Detailed informations
				about the sizes of the
				individual
				dimensions can be obtained from the
				image metadata.

				<p>Alternatively, selecting subsets can be done in three ways using the text field below each selection list:</p>

				<p><b>Discrete Element Selection</b>
				Every element that shall be selected can
				be entered on it's own, separated by commas.
				e.g. "1, 5, 8, 9"</p>
				<p><b>Cohesive Element Selection</b>
				Selecting a complete region "from" a given
				value "to" another can be done by putting a
				hyphen between two values, marking the first
				as the region start and the second as the end.
				Comma-separation still holds and can separate
				either complete regions, or regions and discrete
				selections.
				e.g. 1-5, 8-10, 11</p>
				<p><b>Function Based Selection</b>
				Selection values based on a given function
				can be done by marking the function with a
				leading "f=" and entering the desired
				functionality thereafter. Any single variable
				function or constant contained within the
				javascript math package can be used with
				standard javascript syntax.
				(e.g. math.pow(2, i) for selecting 2, 4, 8,...)</p>
				<p><b>Combining</b>
				The above mentioned functionalities can be
				arbitrarily intermingled as every comma separated
				entry is read and interpreted on it's own.
				e.g. Selecting all Values from 1-10, every eleventh
				entry and the twentieth entry for some reason can
				be done by entering:
				"1-10, 20, f=11*i"	</p>
