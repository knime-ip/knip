	        Calculate features of an image, labeling or an image under consideration of a given 
	        labeling. 
        
	       <p>
	        	Add as many feature sets as you want to the selected feature set panel. Some feature sets
	        	need some input parameters set. Once you have added a feature set you can set the missing 
	        	input parameters in the feature selection panel.
