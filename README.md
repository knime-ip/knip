KNIME Image Processing Extension
====

The KNIME Image Processing Extension adds new nodes to [KNIME Analytics Platform](https://knime.com) to, e.g. read more than 100 different kinds of images (thanks to the Bio-Formats library), apply well-known methods for preprocessing, image segmentation, and classification. Most of the included nodes operate on multi-dimensional image data (e.g. videos, 3D images, multi-channel images or even a combination of them), which is made possible by [ImgLib2](https://imagej.net/ImgLib2). In addition, several nodes to calculate image features (e.g. zernike-, texture- or histogram features) for segmented images (e.g. a single cell) are included. These feature vectors can be used to apply machine learning methods in order to train and apply a classifier. 

The KNIME Image Processing Extension currently provides about 90 nodes for (pre)processing, filtering, segmentation, feature extraction, various views, ....
